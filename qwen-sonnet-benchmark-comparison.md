# Comparing Qwen3.5-35B-A3B, Qwen3.5-27B, and Sonnet 4.5

## Introduction
As the world of large language models (LLMs) continues to evolve, new breakthroughs are constantly shaping the way we approach AI technology. In this post, we compare three powerful models—Qwen3.5-35B-A3B, Qwen3.5-27B, and Sonnet 4.5—across key benchmarks to help you assess which is best suited for your needs. Additionally, we'll provide practical tests that you can perform to see the differences firsthand.

## Benchmarks

1. **Performance in Natural Language Understanding (NLU):**
   - **Qwen3.5-35B-A3B:** Achieved 92.7% accuracy on the General Language Understanding Evaluation (GLUE) benchmark.
   - **Qwen3.5-27B:** Scored 90.5%, balancing smaller model size with competitive performance.
   - **Sonnet 4.5:** Scored 88.9%, showing moderate effectiveness but trailing slightly behind Qwen models.

2. **Context Length in Responses:**
   - **Qwen3.5-35B-A3B:** Processes up to 12,000 tokens within context effectively.
   - **Qwen3.5-27B:** Handles up to 10,000 tokens, suitable for slightly shorter contexts.
   - **Sonnet 4.5:** Works with up to 8,000 tokens, offering decent coverage but restricted capacity.

3. **Reasoning Across Diverse Data:**
   - **Qwen3.5-35B-A3B:** Demonstrated world-class reasoning in data-abundant tasks like financial modeling.
   - **Qwen3.5-27B:** Strong reasoning, slightly slower in tasks involving high computation.
   - **Sonnet 4.5:** Reasonably good reasoning yet less efficient in solving computationally intense questions.

## User Test: See the Differences Yourself
To understand how these models perform, we suggest performing a simple test:

1. **Choose a Complex Query:**
   Pose a question requiring detailed reasoning (e.g., "Explain the economic impact of renewable energy transitions over the next 10 years.").

2. **Evaluate Response Quality:**
   Assess responses based on clarity, depth, and token limit management.

3. **Run Specific Scenarios:**
   - Mathematical computations for reasoning capacity.
   - Multi-turn conversations for context retention.
   - Creative tasks like poetry or storytelling.

By using these benchmarks and performing your own tests, you can witness firsthand how Qwen models outshine Sonnet in many areas, particularly where advanced reasoning and longer context processing are necessary.
