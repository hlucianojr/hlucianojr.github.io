<h1>Understanding Internal Developer Platforms</h1>
<p>Description: Internal Developer Platforms (IDP) are centralized environments that standardize development, operations, and deployment processes within an organization. They aim to streamline workflows and improve productivity by providing a cohesive pre set of tools and governance.  Most company that have implemented DevOps are now having the need to implement some sort of IDP.  This IDP can take the shape of overeload CI/CD tools like Jenkins, Github, homegrown and much more.  However it is clear that we need something better than lipstick over tranditional tools.  For example Jenkins should just be your CI/CD machine and nothing more it should not customize to perform update to operation, monitoring services and it no a service catalog.  Github is great for storing source code, running workflows and collaborating at a distributed level but it is not your service catalog.  It may hold the source code and even the desire status of your Kubernetes cluster but it is not your service catalog.

            An¬†internal developer platform (IDP)¬†is a customized system created in-house or by a third party to improve efficiency for an organization‚Äôs Dev and Ops teams. IDPs provide a central interface where developers can access all the tools and services they need for coding, building, testing, and deploying applications.
            They aim to remove friction during deployment by standardizing tools and best practices. This standardized approach allows developers to focus on writing code rather than configuring tooling and processes.¬†
            At their core, IDPs enable engineers to build, test, integrate, and deploy applications faster and with higher quality.

            An Internal Developer Platform (IDP) is the sum of all the tech and tools that a platform engineering team binds together to pave golden paths for developers. IDPs lower cognitive load across the engineering organization and enable developer self-service, without abstracting away context from developers or making the underlying tech inaccessible. Well designed IDPs follow a Platform as a Product approach, where a platform team builds, maintains and continuously improves the IDP, following product management principles and best practices.

            An internal developer platform is focused on a company‚Äôs internal development practices. You define a set of recommended and supported development paths to production and incrementally "pave" a way through them with an internal platform. To use a real-world analogy, new paths often start out as dirt trails, but as more people use them, they're paved to improve safety while maintaining velocity and throughput. Paved paths within an internal developer platform have similar goals.

            An Internal Developer Portal (IDP) is the engineering system of record for tracking, improving, and building high-quality software. From services and APIs to Kubernetes clusters and data pipelines‚ÄîIDPs abstract away the complexities of ensuring software security, maturity, production readiness, and more‚Äîall using data from your existing tools.

            A deeper dive into the practical implications of IDPs for developers and organizations.  An Internal Developer Platform is a self-service Product made of a set of Tools and Capabilities to empower developers to be self-sufficient and deliver their software efficiently and simplistic enforce organization standards.

            - Increase software quality and observability.
            - Self Service: let me build at my speed and collaborate with others.

            Business Perspective
            - Speed time to market in an increasingly competitive arena.
            - Automation and enforcement of Governance, Security Policy.
