<h1>Understanding Internal Developer Platforms</h1>
<p>Description: Internal Developer Platforms (IDP) are centralized environments that standardize development, operations, and deployment processes within an organization. They aim to streamline workflows and improve productivity by providing a cohesive set of tools and practices.</p>

            An internal developer platform (IDP) is a customized system created in-house or by a third party to improve efficiency for an organization’s Dev and Ops teams. IDPs provide a central interface where developers can access all the tools and services they need for coding, building, testing, and deploying applications.
            They aim to remove friction during deployment by standardizing tools and best practices. This standardized approach allows developers to focus on writing code rather than configuring tooling and processes. 
            At their core, IDPs enable engineers to build, test, integrate, and deploy applications faster and with higher quality.

            An Internal Developer Platform (IDP) is the sum of all the tech and tools that a platform engineering team binds together to pave golden paths for developers. IDPs lower cognitive load across the engineering organization and enable developer self-service, without abstracting away context from developers or making the underlying tech inaccessible. Well designed IDPs follow a Platform as a Product approach, where a platform team builds, maintains and continuously improves the IDP, following product management principles and best practices.

            An internal developer platform is focused on a company’s internal development practices. You define a set of recommended and supported development paths to production and incrementally "pave" a way through them with an internal platform. To use a real-world analogy, new paths often start out as dirt trails, but as more people use them, they're paved to improve safety while maintaining velocity and throughput. Paved paths within an internal developer platform have similar goals.

            An Internal Developer Portal (IDP) is the engineering system of record for tracking, improving, and building high-quality software. From services and APIs to Kubernetes clusters and data pipelines—IDPs abstract away the complexities of ensuring software security, maturity, production readiness, and more—all using data from your existing tools.

            A deeper dive into the practical implications of IDPs for developers and organizations.  An Internal Developer Platform is a self-service Product made of a set of Tools and Capabilities to empower developers to be self-sufficient and deliver their software efficiently and simplistic enforce organization standards.
